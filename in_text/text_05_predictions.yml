    Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data: 5 model prediction data

abstract: >-
  A deep learning model framework was used to make water temperature predictions in 118 river catchments across the U.S. All four model (LR, noQ, obsQ, and simQ) predictions are included.

    data-name: model_{}_predictions.csv
    data-description: >-
      The water temperature predictions from each stream temperature model described in Rahmani et al. 2020. Each file represents a different stream temperature model, where model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev). Model abbreviation "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model, "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
