    data-name: model_{}_predictions.csv
    data-description: >-
      The water temperature predictions from each stream temperature model described in Rahmani et al. 2020. Each file represents a different stream temperature model, where model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev). Model abbreviation "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model, "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
