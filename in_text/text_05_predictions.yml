    Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data: 5 Model predictions

abstract: >-
  <p>This data release component contains water temperature predictions in 118 river catchments
  across the U.S. Predictions are from the four models described by Rahmani et al. (2020):
  locally-fitted linear regression, LSTM-noQ, LSTM-obsQ, and LSTM-simQ.</p>

    data-name: model_{}_predictions.csv
    data-description: >-
      The water temperature predictions from each stream temperature model described in Rahmani et al. 2020. Each file represents a different stream temperature model, where model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev). Model abbreviation "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model, "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
