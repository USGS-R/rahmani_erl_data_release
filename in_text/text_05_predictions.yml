    Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model
    and the value of streamflow data: 5 Model predictions

abstract: >-
  <p>This data release component contains water temperature predictions in 118 river catchments
  across the U.S. Predictions are from the four models described by Rahmani et al. (2020):
  locally-fitted linear regression, LSTM-noQ, LSTM-obsQ, and LSTM-simQ.</p>

  Models were constructed and applied using the code in data release component "4 Models".

  All four models (lr, obsq, simq, and noq) were trained on inputs and water temperature observations from
  2010-10-01 through 2014-09-30, then the models were used to generate predictions for the test period from
  2014-10-01 through 2016-09-30.

  Deep learning (LSTM) model inputs were the meteorological drivers, basin attributes, and,
  for the "obsq" and "simq" models, discharge observations and/or predictions. The "simq" models
  were trained with observed discharge and tested with simulated discharge.
  Model inputs for the locally-fitted auto-regressive model (AR2) were air temperature and observed
  discharge only.

  After the models had been run, predictions were formatted into comma-separated values with a common structure
  across all four models.

    data-description: >-
      Water temperature predictions from each stream temperature model described in Rahmani et al. 2020.
      Each file contains predictions from a different model, where model names are given in the
      filename (modabbrev). Model abbreviation "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model,
      "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated
      discharge, and "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
