    data-name: model_{modabbrev}_evaluation.csv
    data-description: >-
      The performance metrics of each stream temperature model assessed in Rahmani et al. 2020.
      Each file corresponds to a different model, and the structure of the files is the same across all models.
      Model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev): "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model,
      "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and
      "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
