    Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model
    and the value of streamflow data: 6 Model evaluation

abstract: >-
  <p>This data release component contains evaluation metrics used to assess the
  predictive performance of each stream temperature model. For further description,
  see the metric calculations in the supplement of Rahmani et al. (2020), equations S1-S7.</p>

process-description: >-
  Daily model predictions were compared to daily water temperature observations for
  the test period from 2014-10-01 through 2016-09-30. For each model and each monitoring location,
  performance metrics were computed according to equations in the manuscript body and
  supplement of Rahmani et al. 2020 (details in the attribute definitions of this metadata file).

    data-name: model_{modabbrev}_evaluation.csv
    data-description: >-
      The performance metrics of each stream temperature model assessed in Rahmani et al. 2020.
      Each file corresponds to a different model, and the structure of the files is the same across all models.
      Model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev): "lr" refers the locally-fitted auto-regressive model
      (also referred to as AR2 in the Rahmani et al. 2020 manuscript),
      "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and
      "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.

        Unbiased root mean squared error (RMSE), which is calculated as the
        square root of the mean of the differences between
        prediction anomalies (prediction minus mean prediction) and
        observation anomalies (observation minus mean observation).
