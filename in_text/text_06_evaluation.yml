    Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data: 6 model evaluation

abstract: >-
  Several evaluation metrics were used to assess the predictive performance of each stream temperature model. For further description, see the metric calculations in the supplement of Rahmani et al. 2020. Each file correspond to a different model, but the structure of the files is the same across all models.

    data-description: >-
      The performance metrics of each stream temperature model assessed in Rahmani et al. 2020. Each file represents a different stream temperature model, where model names are contained in the filename (modabbrev). Model abbreviation "lr" refers the locally-fitted linear regression model, "obsq" to the model trained with observed discharge, "simq" to the model trained with simulated discharge, and "noq" to the model trained with no discharge information.
