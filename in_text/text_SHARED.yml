  This data release provides all data and code used in Rahmani et al. 2020. Briefly, this project used the USGS Gages II dataset as a test case for temperature prediction using deep learning methods. The paper explores the value of including stream discharge as a predictor in the temperature models, including the value of predicted discharge from a seperate model when no discharge measurements are available.
