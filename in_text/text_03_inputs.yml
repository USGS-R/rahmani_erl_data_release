  Discharge data at the 118 selected USGS monitoring sites were retrieved from the
  USGS National Water Information System (NWIS; U.S. Geological Survey, 2020)
  using the HTTPS and the NWIS web applications programming interface.

  Attribute data for the basins contributing to those 118 USGS monitoring sites
  were downloaded from the GAGES-II database (Falcone 2011).

  Basin-averaged daily meteorological forcing data (precipitation,
  maximum and minimum air temperature, vapor pressure, solar radiation) were obtained by interpolating
  a gridded meteorological dataset (Daymet) (Thornton et al. 2016) from Google Earth Engine (GEE)
  (Gorelick et al. 2017).

  Although some of these datasets were initially downloaded to cover longer periods of time, we subset
  the results to the combined training and test period for this study, 2010-10-01 through 2016-09-30,
  for the analysis by Rahmani et al. (2020) and this data release.
