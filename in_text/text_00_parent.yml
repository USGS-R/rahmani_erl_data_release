  Data release: Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data

abstract: >-
  <p>This data release provides all data and code used in Rahmani et al. (2020) to model stream temperature and assess results.
  Briefly, we used a subset of the USGS GAGES-II dataset as a test case for temperature prediction using deep learning methods.
  The associated manuscript explores the value of including stream discharge as a predictor in the temperature models,
  including the value of predicted discharge from a separate model when no discharge measurements are available.</p>
  <p>The data are organized into these items:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f908db182ce720ee2d0fef9">Spatial Information</a> - Locations of the 118 monitoring sites used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f986594d34e198cb77ff084">Observations</a> - Water temperature observations for the 118 sites used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865abd34e198cb77ff086">Model Inputs</a> - Model inputs, including basin attributes, weather drivers, and discharge</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865cfd34e198cb77ff088">Models</a> - Code and configurations for the stream temperature models</li>
