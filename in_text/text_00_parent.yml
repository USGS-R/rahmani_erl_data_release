  Data release: Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data


abstract: >-
  <p>This data release provides all data and code used in Rahmani et al. 2020. Briefly, this project used the CAMELS dataset as a test case for temperature prediction using deep learning methods. XX
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f908db182ce720ee2d0fef9">Spatial Information</a> - Basin polygons and pour points for 118 river basins used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f986594d34e198cb77ff084">Observations</a> - Water temperature observations and flow observations for the 118 river reaches used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865abd34e198cb77ff086">Model Inputs</a> - Model inputs, including basin characteristics and weather drivers. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865cfd34e198cb77ff088">Models</a> - Code and configuration for stream temperature models.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865e5d34e198cb77ff08a">Model Predictions</a> - Predictions of water temperature</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9865fbd34e198cb77ff08c">Model Evaluation</a> - Performance of models</li>
  <br/>
  <p>This research was funded by the USGS, XX.</p>

build-environment: Multiple computer systems were used to generate these data, including linux, OSX. The open source languages R and Python were used on all systems. XX
