  Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model
  and the value of streamflow data: 2 Observations

abstract: >-
  <p>This data release component contains mean daily stream water temperature observations,
  retrieved from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) and
  used to train and validate all temperature models.
  The model training period was from 2010-10-01 to 2014-09-30, and the test period was from 2014-10-01 to 2016-09-30.</p>
