  Exploring the exceptional performance of a deep learning stream temperature model and the value of streamflow data: 2 observations


abstract: >-
  Mean daily temperature and discharge observations retrieved from NWIS. The temperature observations were used to train and validate all temperature models, while flow observations were used as a model input during training for a subset of the temperature models. The model training period was from 2010-10-01 to 2014-09-30, and the test period was from 2014-10-01 to 2016-09-30.
