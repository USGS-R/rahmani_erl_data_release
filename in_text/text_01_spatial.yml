  Gage coordinates were downloaded from the GAGES-II website (Falcone, 2011)
  and subset to the 118 gages of interest
  using the R programming language (see "Native Data Set Environment"/"native").

  To select the 118 basins, water temperature (see data release component "2 Observations")
  and basin attribute data (data release component "3 Inputs") were initially downloaded for all 9322 gages
  in the GAGES-II database, and sites were then subset to those (1) with more than
  60% of days between 2010/10/01 and 2014/09/30 having observed daily temperatures, and (2)
  whose contributing basins contained no major dams (more than 50 ft in height, or having more than 5000 acre feet storage).
  This subsetting process yielded 118 basins for inclusion in the modeling applications and this data release.
